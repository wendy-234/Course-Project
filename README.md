One of the most common reasons for missing appointments out there is forgetting or mixing up appointments 
since there hasn't been someone to remind them about it or they just simply don't have the 
adequate system to assist them with their respective needs.

It is clear that when patients miss appointments, practices lose money. Having 
said that, keeping those statistics in mind; as my final project, I chose to go after
the idea of building an application that will be based on the idea of text/push notifications.
It would bring basic functionality and would get rid of unnecessary and expensive services as reminders.

Is a type of time management reminder that is designed to alert the user of important events
esentially You can set reminders and then the app reminds you when it's time.
It automatically sends customized text message or email reminders at any time, any date and 
personalizes each reminder for the customer.
In todays world people have busy lives, thats why sending push notification reminders can
be an important thing to do to ensure you stay at the top of your to-do list, and utilise your
time effectively.
